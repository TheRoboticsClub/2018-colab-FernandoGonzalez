# Stattes Macine with Turtlebot Robot
The target of this exercise is to create a states machine. The behavior of the robot will be go forward untill it sees my hand.
When robot sees my hand, it will go backward and then, it will turn. So, we have three states:
* *Go Forward*
* *Go Backward*
* *Turning*
