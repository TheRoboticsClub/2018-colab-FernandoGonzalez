# Introduction:
  This library is used to measure the odometry of the servomotor "Parallax feedback 360ยบ".
  
# About Feedback Signal:
   Firt one, we need to undestand the operation of feedback signal.
  It is a PWM signal. What that means? PWM means "Pulse Weidth Modulation". It is a signal of information. 
  How this signal be able to transport information? Modulatin his pulse weidth. Let's look an example:
