  It is a robot with remote control that works using Arduino and Raspberry pi 3 with Ubuntu mate installed. In addition, 
I did it using ROS. If you want to see a picture of the robot, you will find it here:

  The operation is as follow: The remote control works with two Arduinos Nano (the emitter and the receiver). The emitter have
two buttons: one of them is for switch the voice control to manual control, or vice versa. The other one serves to make to go
forward to the robot or stop it. If the robot is in voice control, it will receive commands by a microphone instaled at the remote 
control. To conclude, to say that when the robot is moving, it avoid the obstacles.
