It a function called "move". That function receives two parameters. One of them is the linear velocity and the other is the
angular velocity. That function was implemented for a robot with two wheels that they were moved by two servomotors.
That function allows you to move the robot fordward, backward and to do turns faster or slower depending on the two paremeters.
