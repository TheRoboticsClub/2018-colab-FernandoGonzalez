  It is a robot made with a chasis of a toy tank and a Arduino Mega. It uses two DC Motors, a Servomotor and the ultrasonic sensor "HC-SR04". 
The direction of rotation of the DC Motor works with a H-Bridge made by me with 2N2222A tansistors. The ultrasonic sensor is on 
top of the servomotor so that it moves. In this way, the robot may measure distances to rigth side or left side, and the robot choose
where it have to go. If there is obstacles in both sides (righ and left), the robot will retreat.
  All of this works with a power bank.
