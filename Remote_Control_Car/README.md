It is about a car completely printable with a 3D printer. That car has two main functionalities:
	One of them is the autonomous navigation, avoiding obstacles and falls, or following a line; and the other is 
the remote control functionality, by which, the car is driven by means of a remote control with two joysticks.
	  For this proyect, we have needed a Ultrasonic sensor, three infrared sensor, four DC motors, Raspberry Pi 3 
    model b+ and two Arduino nano.
